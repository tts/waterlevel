<h3>Water</h3>

<p>December 2015 is soon history. Although not unique in Southern Finland, the month was still rather unusual, weather-wise. Warm and stormy. In Helsinki, this combination means that the Baltic Sea comes closer.</p>

<p>Around Viikki, in the Northern corner of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanhankaupunginselk%C3%A4" target="_blank">Vanhankaupunginlahti bay area</a>, fields were still partly flooded on the 12th. A week earlier, on the 6th, Finns celebrated the 98th year of Independence. Amidst all festivities, water started to creep in. In the Arabianranta suburb, on the Western bank of the bay, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonrikberg/23520506129/in/photolist-Bo2HDm-CmeJTN-CdcJnV-Cx5wxg-BQqK2K" target="_blank">dry land was almost 300 m higher than usual</a>.</p>

<p>Yet, these are minor shifts compared to <a href="http://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/sea-level-records-on-the-finnish-coast" target="_blank">what happened on Epiphany, 2005</a>. And even then it was not <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=uk+floods&espv=2&biw=1920&bih=1091&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjJgOSmxoPKAhXElHIKHXpcC6oQ_AUIBygC#q=uk+floods&tbm=isch&pws=0" target="_blank">that bad</a>.</p>

<h3>Science</h3>

<p>Mareographs, i.e. sea level gauges, operated by <a href="http://fmi.fi">Finnish Meteorological Institute</a> (FMI), measure water level several times a day. There are 14 of these clever little tools floating out there, and I will probably never have the chance to see any of them. But - I can read them all! Measurement <a href="https://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/open-data">data are open</a>.</p>

<p>On the 29th, at 9 AM, the Helsinki Kaivopuisto gauge woke up, burped, and recorded an observation that the water level was 35 cm. So what does that mean? <a href="http://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/theoretical-mean-sea-level" target="_blank">Read more here</a>, it's a bit theoretical.</p>

<h3>Ice Age (2015)</h3>

<p>What's interesting is that in Fennoscandia, land uplift after the last Ice Age <a href="https://ilmasto-opas.fi/en/ilmastonmuutos/suomen-muuttuva-ilmasto/-/artikkeli/338246aa-d354-4607-b087-cd9e0d4a3d04/maankohoaminen-hillitsee-merenpinnan-nousua-suomen-rannikolla.html" target="_blank">counteracts somewhat the sea level rise</a>. Here are few facts by <a href="http://www.fgi.fi/fgi/themes/land-uplift" target="_blank">Finnish Geospatial Institute (FGI)</a>:</p>

<blockquote style="font-size:14px">Near the Gulf of Bothnia, where the ice was thickest, the current uplift rate is about 2 centimetre per year, and there is still some 100 meters to rise.</blockquote>

<p>So, which one wins: sea or land? We do not know yet. So far, <i>the sea level rise has been smaller than the uplift rate at the Finnish coast, so new land will still appear from the sea</i>, as FGI puts it.</p>
